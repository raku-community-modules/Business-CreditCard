    - Completely reworked the handling of "cardtype": instead of
      a string, it now returns a CardTypes enum (which is also
      exported) which can be used for numeric comparisons.  Based
      the lookup logic on both the Perl's equivalent module, and
      the information on Wikipedia
    - Added current test-suite of Perl's equivalent module,
      plus some fixes
    - Added another author, which feels appropriate by the amount
      of refactoring done

0.1.1  2024-12-20T20:00:58+01:00
    - Initial version as a Raku Community module
